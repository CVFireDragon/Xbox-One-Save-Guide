## Required
- Computer (to put the files on)
- Xbox One
- USB Stick

## Tutorial
1. Install "UFO.Transfer" on your Xbox from the Microsoft store. Also install "File Explorer" on your Xbox if it isn't on there. 
2. Plug your USB Stick Into any port of the Xbox, the one on the left of the console is recommended.
3. On the Xbox, go to settings and then "Display & Sound", "Video output", "Video fidelity & overscan", and untick the box that says "Apps can add a border".
4. Open UFO Transfer and open settings (top right corner).
5. Press the "Open in File Explorer" button, and then go up to the top part and click "Packages".
6. Find the game you want to rip saves from. I use Minecraft, so I will look for "Microsoft.MinecraftUWP". Once you've opened that folder, you go to "LocalState", "games", "com.mojang" and then "minecraftWorlds".
7. In here, there's a lot of numbers and letters but just search for the one with the icon your world has (go in one and look at the picture then go out if it's not the one).
8. Once you've found your world, press the start button, and press "Select All". Then, press the start button and press copy.
9. Go to your USB Stick by going to the sidebar and selecting the option under "This Device".
10. Press the three lines button and then press paste.
11. Wait for all the files to load into the folder, and then remove the USB Stick from the Xbox.
12. On the computer, plug in your USB Stick, find it in your file explorer, and you're done.
