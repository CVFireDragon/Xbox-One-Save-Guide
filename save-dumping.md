## Required:
- PC with Windows 10
- Xbox One
- Internet Access

## Tutorial:
1. Install "UFO.Transfer" on your Xbox and PC with the Microsoft store. Also install "File Explorer" on your Xbox if it isn't on there. 
2. Make sure the Xbox One and PC are connected to the same network.
3. On the Xbox, go to settings and then "Display & Sound", "Video output", "Video fidelity & overscan", and untick the box that says "Apps can add a border".
4. Open up UFO Transfer on your Xbox and find the settings icon in the top corner. (It only appears if step 3 was done!)
5. Click the "Open in File Explorer" button, and then go up to the top part and click "Packages".
6. Find the game you want to rip saves from. I use Minecraft, so I will look for "Microsoft.MinecraftUWP". Once you've opened that folder, you go to "LocalState", "games", "com.mojang" and then "minecraftWorlds".
7. In here, there's a lot of numbers and letters but just search for the one with the icon your world has (go in one and look at the picture then go out if it's not the one).
8. Once you've found your world, press the start button also known as the three lines button, and press "Select All". Then, press start/3 lines button and press copy.
9. Go to the root folder by clicking "This Device" on the left sidebar, and find the Downloads folder. If it has stuff in it, then use a different one or create a new folder. 
10. Once you're in a folder, press the three lines button / start button and press paste. Remember the name of the folder. Open up UFO Transfer on the Xbox and press the + Others button. Go to "This Device" on the sidebar, and find the folder it was in.
11. Open it and press the select button on the bottom of the screen. Do not close UFO Transfer.
12. Open UFO Transfer on the computer and then go to the Xbox and click the search for devices button. Then when you see your PC name, you can select it and then go back to local at the top.
13. Click the three green boxes with check marks, and press the send button. Select your PC, and it should start going to your PC. If it fails, press retry. It can happen.
14. When it's done, go to the settings on your computer's UFO Transfer and click the "Open in File Explorer" option. Hopefully, your files were transferred!
